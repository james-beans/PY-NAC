# PY-NAC
Noughts-And-Crosses/Tic-Tac-Toe in **[Python](https://python.org)**.

<hr />

## Dependencies:
- **[Python](https://python.org)** (You probably already have this installed already.)
  -  If you're not sure you have Python installed check your system packages for Linux and Mac and run the command `Python3`.
  -  Or if you're not sure on Windows, check your system PATH variables to see if you have it or run the command `py` to check.
      - To exit the **[Python](https://python.org)** shell/console that is built-in with **[Python](https://python.org)** type `exit()`.

> [!WARNING]
> **[Python](https://python.org)** is needed for even just running the pre-compiled executable from the releases.

### Python import dependencies:
- **[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)** (built in with **[Python](https://python.org)** but might need an install using `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` for Linux)
- **[Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)** (built in with **[Python](https://python.org)**)
- **[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)** (external; download with pip: `pip install numpy`)

<br>

> [!TIP]
> You can use a different compiler like **[Pyinstaller]()** if **[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)** doesn't work but it is unrecommended because of the generated executables being false-flagged by antiviruses.

> [!WARNING]
> You will need a few more things for **[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)** to work properly. Like a C compiler. See a **[list of those things here](https://nuitka.net/user-documentation/user-manual.html#requirements)**.

### Python compiling dependencies:
- **[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)** (external (for compiling); download with pip: `pip install nuitka`)

<hr />

> [!WARNING]
> I will **not** be providing commands for other python compilers apart from **[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)**.

## Compile commands:
### Linux: ``
### Windows: ``
